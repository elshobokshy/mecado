Easy way to let your friends know which gift you'd like on your birthday.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
```
* Web server with URL rewriting
* PHP 7.0 or newer
* MySQL/MariaDB database containing a 'mecado' database
* Composer globaly installed
```
### Installing and Running

The only thing necessary in order to run the project is the following command with super user permissions

```
composer install
```

You'll need to go over the installation and insert the database information according to whatever you're using (database credentials mostly), and don't forget to enter 'mecado' as the database name after creating it.

Then, a server is running on 127.0.0.1:8081/


### Tests

For testing, a user is available for connection:

email : John.Walter@gmail.com

password : testest

There is no list for John Walter himself becauseof the config data when creating DB.
You must create one if you want to test it.

Enjoy !
